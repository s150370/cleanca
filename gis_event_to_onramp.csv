2023 Community Creek Clean-Up Tickets, Sat, Oct 7, 2023 at 8:00 AM | Eventbrite

Join us on Saturday, October 7, 2023, from 8:00 AM–12:00 PM (noon) as we tackle the litter and invasive vegetation that has become overgrown and reduces the visibility of the Sacramento River. This year we are also adding some fun art and trail projects. Creek Clean-Up will focus on the Sacramento River Trail near the site of the new bike park, between N. Market St. and the Arboretum Loop Trailhead (975 N. Market St.).

During these four short hours, hundreds of volunteers will gather to help clear the trash left on the trail and remove Himalayan Blackberry, Ailanthus, Pyracantha, Fruiting Mulberry, Acacia, and Black Locust.

Bring your water bottle, wear closed-toe shoes, long pants, sunscreen, and come out and help restore this riparian oasis. You can make a substantial contribution to beautifying this scenic space in the heart of Redding during a single morning of labor involving hundreds of your fellow citizens.

Gloves, safety goggles, buckets, and garden tools will be made available for use. Please bring your own loppers, garbage pickers, or safety equipment if you have it.

Kids must be 10 years of age or older to participate. No exceptions. Volunteers between the ages of 10 and 18 are allowed to bring a waiver (available on the City of Redding Creek Clean-Up webpage—link below) to check-in that has been signed by a parent or guardian prior to event day.

Participants between 10 and 18 years old are REQUIRED to have a waiver signed by a parent or guardian!

Print yours here, have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it to our Registration Table on Creek Clean-Up Day!"
